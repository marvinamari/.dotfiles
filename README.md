### TMUX
In copy mode Y will yank the current line:
Once youâ€™ve copied some stuff, you can do more than just paste the last thing:

           #           List all paste buffers.
           -           Delete the most recently copied buffer of text.
           =           Choose which buffer to paste interactively from a list.
           [           Enter copy mode to copy text or view the history.
           ]           Paste the most recently copied buffer of text. 
(I have [ remapped to Escape and ] remapped to p. I use - for split-window -v, so I moved delete-buffer to +.)

tmux remembers old buffers and prefix + = lets you paste them arbitrarily!

Mount external drive:
`https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-permanently-mount-a-drive-in-linux-and-why-you-should/`
`https://developerinsider.co/auto-mount-drive-in-ubuntu-server-22-04-at-startup/`
1. Make directory which will be the mount point for drive
`mkdir /mnt/name`
> change ownership of directory to user `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /mnt/name`
2. Locate the name of your drive
`lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,UUID,MOUNTPOINTS`
3. Copy the UUID and file system type
4. Edit fstab
`sudo vim /etc/fstab`
5. Add a new entry of the following format
```
<file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
UUID=<UUID> <PATH_TO_MOUNT> <DRIVE_TYPE>  defaults        0       0

# Example entry for USB1
UUID=632D-7154 /media/USB1   exfat    defaults        0       0
```
6. Before rebooting verify fstab is valid, if not disk may become unbootable
`sudo findmnt --verify`
> If any errors or warnings occur something may be wrong.
7. Reboot and test drive
`lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,UUID,MOUNTPOINTS`


Change docker storage location
`evodify.com/change-docker-storage-location`
